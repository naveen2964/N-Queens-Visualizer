## Introduction
The N Queens problem is a classical computer science puzzle. This visualizer allows users to see how different algorithms attempt to solve the puzzle by placing queens on the board in real-time.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of the N Queens problem.
- Support for various algorithms (Backtracking, etc.).
- Adjustable board size (from 4x4 to NxN).
- Real-time visual feedback of the queen placement process.
- Step-by-step animation for each algorithm.
  
## Technologies Used
